# 6DOF_Satellite_Simulation_using_Matlab-Simulink

This is an 6 Degree of freedom orbital simulator of a satellite performing a rendez-vous manoeuvre builted for the class of Dynamics and Control of Spacecrafts at Polythecnic of Turin. The manoeuvre to be performed are the following:
  -Free Drift
  
  -Hohmann Transfer
  -Radial Boost Transfer
  -Final Approach
  
The model can be runned using a PD controller or a second order Sliding Mode controller.
